It's the thought of bein' young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beatin' louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Sing along to Elton John
And to that feelin', we're just gettin' started
When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you fallin' behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say
I wanna dance, the music's got me goin'
Ain't nothin' that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancin' fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
There's always somethin' that's standin' in the way
But if you don't let it faze ya, you'll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe, yeah, 'cause there's no lookin' back
There ain't no one to prove, we don't got this on lock, yeah
The wait is over
The time is now, so let's do it right (yeah), mm
Yeah, we'll keep goin'
And stay up until we see the sunrise (yeah)
And we'll say
I wanna dance, the music's got me goin'
Ain't nothin' that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancin' fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
No, we don't need permission to dance
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na (hey), da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na
Well, let me show ya
That we can keep the fire alive, mmm
'Cause it's not over
'Til it's over, say it one more time, say
I wanna dance, the music's got me goin' (music's got me goin')
Ain't nothin' that can stop how we move, yeah (hey)
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancin' fools (ooh, like we're dancin' fools)
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (we know how to land)
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight (now)
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
